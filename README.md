# 🏗️ Nirman

### AI-Powered Visual Website Builder

**Build production-ready websites visually — no complex coding required.**

<br/>

</div>

---

## 📌 Overview

**Nirman** is a modern SaaS web application that empowers users to build websites visually through an intelligent, component-driven editing experience. It bridges the gap between no-code simplicity and developer-grade control — combining a structured component editor with real-time preview and AI-assisted customization.

> _Nirman (निर्माण) — meaning "construction" or "creation" in Nepali/Sanskrit — reflects the project's core purpose: building things from the ground up, intelligently._

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js** — Component-based UI
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** — Icon library

> Authentication and session state are managed server-side via **better-auth**, eliminating the need for a frontend state management library.

### Backend

- **Node.js** + **Express.js** — REST API server

### Database

- **Prisma ORM** — Type-safe database access
- **PostgreSQL** (via [Neon DB](https://neon.tech)) — Scalable serverless Postgres

### Authentication

- **better-auth** — Secure, session-based authentication

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Component-Based Editor

Every UI element in Nirman is a structured object stored in a JSON component tree. This enables dynamic, isolated updates without full page reloads and makes the editor highly extensible.

### Editing System

Rather than drag-and-drop (which introduces layout complexity), Nirman uses a **click-to-edit** model:

1. Click a component → opens its editing panel
2. Modify content or styles → reflected instantly in the canvas
3. Use the AI prompt bar → describe a change and apply it automatically

### Data Storage

- Website layouts are persisted as **JSON component trees**
- Managed via **Prisma ORM** for type-safe, schema-driven access
- Hosted on **Neon PostgreSQL** for serverless scalability

### Authentication

`better-auth` handles all user sessions securely on the server side, keeping the frontend lean and stateless.
